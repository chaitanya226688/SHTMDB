The constants are inside the App constants
The Context is inside context
The Screen are in screens folder.
The Components that are written inside HomeScreen can also be written inside sperate files and can be imported to the HomeScreen
The API Fetching can be improved a bit more and make it standardized for every api call
The Unit Tests are inside _tests_
